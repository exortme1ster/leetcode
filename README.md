## üß† Problem Breakdowns

### Easy üü¢

#### 1. [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/)

- **Approach**: Simple approach by just going through all element of array
- **Challenges**: No challenges
- **Time Complexity**: 0(n^2)
- **Space Complexity**: 0(1)

#### 2. [Palindrome Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/description/)

- **Approach**: Compare original string to reversed one
- **Challenges**: No challenges
- **Time Complexity**: 0(n)
- **Space Complexity**: 0(n)

#### 3. [Roman To Int](https://leetcode.com/problems/roman-to-integer/description/)

- **Approach**: The problem here is that we can meet next values that can be combination of prev+next, so what we do here is basically, when we see a number that is less than the next number, we substract first digit and then add second (like IV: substract 1 from total and add 5 results in 4)
- **Challenges**: Coming up with the optimized version, originally just hardcoded values (which is not cool lol)
- **Time Complexity**: 0(n)
- **Space Complexity**: 0(1)

### Medium üü°

#### 1. [Problem Name with Link]

- **Approach**: Brief description of your approach.
- **Challenges**: What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?
- **Time Complexity**: Your analysis.
- **Space Complexity**: Your analysis.

... [Repeat for other medium problems]
